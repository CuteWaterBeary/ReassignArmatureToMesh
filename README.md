# Why?

Reassigns Mesh weights to the selected Armature based on object names. You know, when you tweak your Dynamic Bones in
Blender and then your avatar is all messed up if you try to just replace the mesh on already configured avatar. Without
this tool you'd have to re-configure your avatar from scratch on the new model.

# How?

Just drop import the `.unitypackage` and open the interface from the main menu `Rhea`. If you have multiple meshes using the
same Armature on the model, just increase the count to the appropriate value and assign them all.
